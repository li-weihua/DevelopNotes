NLP
=====

encoder-decoder model architecture:

* **Encoder-only models**: Good for tasks that require understanding of the input, such as sentence classification and named entity recognition.
* **Decoder-only models**: Good for generative tasks such as text generation.
* **Encoder-decoder models** or **sequence-to-sequence models**: Good for generative tasks that require an input, such as translation or summarization.

Decoding Methods
******************

There are mainly tree decoding methods: ``Greedy search``, ``Beam search``, and ``Sampling``.
